# Background
Create a web page with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap that allows you to easily navigate and filter through the dataset provided.

## Objectives
For this project we are creating a custom HTML web page. that will allow us to pull up information from the UFO dataset that waas provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects. We then need to write code that appends the table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting
Create columns for date/time, city, state, country and shape.
last but not least we will need to add input boxes to be able to easily filter through the provided data.

## Results
when opening the website our client will see a basic introduction and title with the picture at the top, as the client scrolls down they will begin to see all the data and filters that we have. we have 5 input boxes that we created allowing us to easily filter through all the recorded sightings in our data.

## Summary 
We have created a page that looks clean and allows the user to filter through the different criteria in our data set using the search bars created. One big drawback about our search bar is trying to validate the sightings that happened which can be better described as the limitation of our dataset. If the sighting reports included the number of people that saw the UFO it would help validating the claims and filter out false reports. Having as much data as possible for website would make it as good as it can possible be. My two recommendations for improving this website would 
1. to have more data that has more information including how many people witnessed the event or how many reports were recieved regarding each event.
3. setup the site to constantly update our data adding new sightings to our page.
